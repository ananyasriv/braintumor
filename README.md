This repository was created to help clarify how to utilise flask and gunicorn to easily deploy a python/keras deep learning model as a web app on Heroku. This example features code for online deployment of a multi-class medical image classification model, based on ResNet-50 network architecture.  The trained model achieved accuracy of more than 98.8% on the test set.

The Brain Tumor Detection project aims to utilize deep learning techniques for the classification of brain tumors using MRI images. The project focuses on identifying three different types of brain tumors and includes a category for images with no tumor present. By developing a multi-classification deep learning model, we can assist radiologists in accurately identifying brain tumors, potentially reducing errors and improving patient care.
